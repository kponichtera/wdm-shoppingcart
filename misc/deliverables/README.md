## Deployment requirements

1. Configured Kubernetes context
   * Configured user should have permissions to manage resources of the cluster
2. [Helm](https://helm.sh/)
3. (Optionally) [k9s](https://k9scli.io/) text user interface for Kubernetes - for monitoring and resilience testing

## Deployment guide

The system is delivered as a Helm Chart and can be simply installed with one command:

```shell
helm install shopping-cart shopping-cart-1.0.0.tgz
```

Or alternatively, by using Helm Chart repository, hosted on GitHub:

```shell
helm repo add shopping-cart https://wdm2022.github.io/shopping-cart/
helm upgrade --install shopping-cart shopping-cart
```

The Chart will display in its deployment notes the information on how to connect to the API gateway of the system, 
depending on how the system was deployed:
* URL if Ingress was used
* port exposed on one of the cluster's workers if `NodePort` service type was used
* address and port of the load balancer if `LoadBalancer` service type was used
* commands to execute locally to perform port forwarding to the Kubernetes' service if `ClusterIP` service type was used (default)

The default installation will deploy one instance of each microservice and three single-replica MongoDB clusters.
This is preferable for Kubernetes clusters with limited resources (eg. minikube), but does not offer high availability.
In order to deploy the system with multiple replicas of each microservice and MongoDB clusters with two replicas, execute:

```shell
# From archive
helm upgrade --install shopping-cart shopping-cart-1.0.0.tgz --values ha-values.yml
# From repo
helm upgrade --install shopping-cart shopping-cart --values ha-values.yml
```

The amount of replicas can be adjusted in the _ha-values.yml_ file.

## Testing resilience

Our recommended tool for testing resilience of the system is [k9s](https://k9scli.io/), 
a text user interface client (TUI) for Kubernetes.

It gives an easy insight into the cluster resources, allows to monitor status of individual Pods
as well as their CPU and memory usage.
It also allows to delete Pods to check how the system behaves when there are failing components in the system
and shows how quickly these components are recreated by the cluster.
